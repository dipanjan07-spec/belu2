            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>Hello everyone! My name is Divyangsha and this is <b>Belu!</b></p>

            <img src="belu.jpg" width="300" height="350" alt="A photo of the dog named Belu">

            <p>
                Belu is a very timid dog that lives in our neighborhood.
                Oh! I am so sorry—I forgot to tell <i>where</i> Belu lived!
                He lives in our neighborhood in Kolkata, West Bengal, India.
            </p>

            <p>
                He is very cute but somewhat timid.
                He has a sister named Mukh-kalo and his mother is named Iti.
                His favorite color is blue, specifically <b>#080aff</b>, which is why this webpage uses that color for the text.
            </p>

        <!-- FIRST ADVENTURE -->
        <section class="story">
            <h2 class="adventure-title">His First Adventure</h2>

            <p>
                It was a normal day in Belu's house. Belu had just eaten his breakfast of eggs on toast.
                As he stepped outside, he stopped to wonder…
                Oh! He had totally forgotten. Today was the first day of the <b>book fair!</b>
            </p>

            <p>
                Belu decided to go to the book fair, but deep within he knew he was only there for the sweets.
                Suddenly, his neurons linked—sweets cost money.
                But where would he get that money from?
            </p>

            <p>
                First, he thought of asking his mom.
                No way! She would give him a scolding instead.
                That left only one option—his sister, Mukh-kalo.
            </p>

            <p>He lied and told her that he was only going to buy some <i>books</i>.</p>

            <div class="dialogue">
                <p><span class="speaker">Belu:</span> Sister, I want to go to the fair.</p>
                <p><span class="speaker">Mukh-kalo:</span> Good! Go to the fair, but don’t get lost.</p>
                <p><span class="speaker">Belu:</span> I won’t get lost… but I don’t have any money.</p>
                <p><span class="speaker">Belu:</span> Oh sister, will you please give me some money?</p>
                <p><span class="speaker">Mukh-kalo:</span> Yes, but you must promise to buy only books.</p>
                <p><span class="speaker">Belu:</span> I promise!</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                After getting his way, Belu washed his face and ran to catch the bus to Karunamoyee.
                Once he reached the book fair, he knew the day would only get better.
            </p>

            <p>
                He took one look at the books and ran straight to the sweet stalls.
                Gulab Jamuns, rasmalai—this was heaven!
            </p>

            <p>
                But suddenly, his worst fear came true.
                He spotted his mom and her friends approaching.
                Before he could escape, her hand grabbed his collar.
            </p>

            <p>
                “Not so fast, young one!” she exclaimed.
                Belu returned home with a scolding—but at least his stomach was full.

        <h3 class="adventure-title">— His Second Adventure —</h3>
        <h3>
            <b>Going cycling</b>
        </h3>
        <p style="white-space: pre-line;">
            It was Belu's big day! This was the day when he would finally learn cycling!
            His tutor was, of course, Mukh-kalo his beloved sister.
            The first thing you have to learn is.. she said.

            Is what?
            You have to keep your hands on the cycle-bars and <b>never</b> let go.
            Belu agreed and she began pushing him up the road while he was paddling.
            Slowly his speed increased and so did he confidence.
            It was at this time that she had stopped pushing him and he was moving on his own.
            Belu was in a thrill! He felt the wind in his face and realized that she had stopped pushing him.
            Immediately Belu lost control and hit a fruit seller's cart which <b>whacked</b> him in the face.
        </p>
        <p style="white-space: pre-line;">
            Why did you let go! exclaimed Belu.
            But you were doing so well! she said.
            Maybe I can't cycle :( said Belu, still with a watermelon on his head.
            After hearing these words, Mukh-kalo felt sad and decided to let him learn on his own.
            Belu was puzzled as to why she went back into the house but all of his thoughts cleared
            When he saw his mom come out with a frying pan in her hands!
        </p>
        <p style="white-space: pre-line">
            Immediately Belu got up on the cycle and started paddling for his life, he paddled and paddled
            until his mom was out of sight.
            I'm finally safe! exclaimed belu and then a thought went into his head..
            Wait if I moved on my own, then that means.
            I learn't cycling exclaimed Belu and started paddling back to his house whe he felt a hand on his shoulder.
            Belu ran and ran straight to his house and then locked the door.
            Never again will I ever cycle! exclaimed Belu.
            This led to his fear of cycles amongst him and his sister, which is still prominent today.
